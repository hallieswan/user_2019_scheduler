# user_2019_scheduler

The useR! 2019 conference is scheduled for July 9-12 in Toulouse, France. A schedule of talks was recently released on the [conference website](http://www.user2019.fr/talk_schedule/) in a table format. The goal of this app is to make selecting talks and constucting a reasonable schedule easier.  

The user can add events to their calendar and then download a csv of the events. The user can then import the events to their Google Calendar.

# Use the scheduler online

The scheduler will be hosted here: [https://hallietheswan.com/shiny/sample-apps/user_2019_scheduler/](https://hallietheswan.com/shiny/sample-apps/user_2019_scheduler/).
